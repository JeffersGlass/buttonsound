Holds the code and description for a random-sound player.

This project was begun based on a conversation with on 5/1/15. A breif description:

"This project should consist of a small(ish) box with two buttons. If you press one button, the box should play a randomly selected sound from a collection of sound files. If you press the other button, the box should play a randomly selected sound from a different collection of sound files. These sound files will be continually updated/added to."
